# Opinion-Polls
A polling web app for popular opinions.

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) where users vote between 2 closely related or widely contested options in various fields such as sports, technology, vehicles, smart phones etc.

However, the backend is not yet deployed and can only be hosted locally. The repository can be cloned from [here](https://github.com/ChadGichuki/opinion-polls-json-server.git)

When the app is running you should expect to see a home page like this:
